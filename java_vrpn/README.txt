Notes on this java implementation:

- you must have sun's java sdk 1.4 installed in its standard place
	(C:\Program Files\Java\).

- when you build the java_vrpn Java project, it will generate vrpn_TrackerRemote.h
	which is used by the C++ project

- when you build the TrackerRemote C++ project, it will create a .dll that needs
	to be in your path or executable directory.

- the vrpn directory in .../vrpn/java_vrpn need to be in your CLASSPATH or
	moved to be in your CLASSPATH.
