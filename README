VRPN Readme:
	The Virtual-Reality Peripheral Network (VRPN) is the PC-at-a-station
implementation that will drive trackers, buttons and sound for each VR
station.
	It's implemented in Linux (and is being ported to Windows by Phil
Winston and/or Jun Chen).  linux_src holds the server application for the
linux boxes.  The current directory holds the library source.

	vrpn_Connection: Network layer
	vrpn_Tracker: Both local and remote tracker code
	vrpn_Button: Both local and remote button code
	vrpn_Sound: Both local and remote sound code

	In all cases, base class is not what you instance.  There are local
(server-side) derived classes for each device.  There is a remote device that
is used by the client-side (user application).

Things to do:
	Fix ttest/t_diags on PC/linux
	Get David to make some more python doobies
	Get some trackers working!!!!!

Problems:

***	The reports from the tracker are not yet being parsed correctly
(orientation is wrong when it ends up at the application).

How to reduce latency on the tracker:
    In any case:
	Run in a way that there isn't swapping going on.
	Probably want to renice the process to a negative priority

    The hack:
	Edit /usr/src/linux/include/asm/params.h and change HZ from 100 to 1000
		to increase the rate at which tty_io.c:flush_to_ldisc() is
		called to move characters from the serial driver
	'setserial /dev/ttyS1 uart 16550' to disable input buffering on that
		serial port and force and interrupt each time a character
		arrives at the buffer
	These two together (absent swapping) cause the driver to read at most
		two characters at a time from the serial port at 19200 baud.

    The real solution:
	Write a new device driver for the tracker that buffers up characters
		in the top-half driver, timestamps the first one with the
		processor tick count, and sets a flag when it has a full
		report.  The read should grab directly from this buffer and
		cook the report in user time.
