This directory contains test and example files for using a Phantom
force-feedback device with VRPN.  They were written by John Stone
at the NIH National Research Resource on molecular dynamics at the
Beckman Institute at UIUC.

This README is made by Russ Taylor, so hopefully it is accurate.

testvrpn.C:
	This opens the Phantom as a tracker, button, and forcedevice.  It prints out all tracker messages, button messages, amd force messages (should there be force messages?)

glvrpn.C:
	This opens and openGL window and displays the tracker as it moves around (along with a line from the origin to the tracker).  It is a good example of how to use a VRPN tracker with openGL.

Others:
	Good question
