
This directory contains the source and test files for the quaternion 
library, libquat.a.  It is based on Warren Robinett's adapted version of Ken
Shoemake's code, as seen in Shoemake's 1985 SIGGRAPH paper.

For those not familiar with quaternions, they are a
concise and efficient way of describing rotations and orientations of
three-dimensional objects.  (Two good references for this subject are
Ken Shoemake's 1985 SIGGRAPH papers "Quaternion Calculus for Animation"
and "Animating Rotation with Quaternion Curves" in the '85
proceedings.)

The library is built on Ken Shoemake's code (as presented in the appendix of
the first paper listed above) and implements the most common quaternion
functions, as well as some more obscure ones.  In particular, there are
conversion routines between vectors, matrices and quaternions, as well as
various vector and matrix operations.

Permission to use this code is granted to non-commercial organizations
provided that acknowledgement of the authors and funding agencies is given.

Documentation on individual routines is in quat.h.

See header of quat.c and quat.h for more info.


Example Programs
================

These files are here for running random tests on the source code, and for
doing conversions between quats and matrices, etc.  They are handy for
debugging source programs using quaternions.

Files:
------

    eul.c - convert from euler angles to quaternion
    
    qmat.c - converts matrix to quaternion

    qmult.c - multiplies two quaternions and shows result as a matrix and
                a quat

    qxform.c - does xform of a vector

    qmake.c -  make a quaternion from an axis & angle;  show result as
    	    	quat and matrix
