        Adding Chris VanderKnyff's changes that enable DLL linkage
        for applications.  Heading towards enabling C# and other language
        support.

	* vrpn_Router_Sierra_Server.C : Adding VRPN_CALLBACK.
	* vrpn_Router_Sierra_Server.h : same.
        * sierra_router_server.dsp : Making it depend on the project
                that causes both VRPN and VRPNDLL projects to be built, rather
                than on VRPN.  If you try to make it depend on both
                VRPN and VRPNDLL, you get linking trouble.

	* vrpn_Router_Sierra_ServerMain.C :
		 Using vrpn_gettimeofday() not gettimeofday()

2002-12-06  Russell M. Taylor II  <taylorr@cs.unc.edu>

	* sierra_router_server.dsp : DSP files have been modified to not do
		definitions of VRPN_NO_STREAMS and other constants directly,
		rather these are now set by editing vprn_Configure.h.  Also,
		made projects compile in both debug and release versions.

	* sierra_router_server.dsp: Moved here, standardized settings.
